Our project is a balanced fitness app that aims to combine workout recording, sleep
tracking, and dietary analysis using AI. The goal is to enable users to take a systematic
approach to fitness by recording all their health data in one app, with an intuitive,
beginner-friendly UI. After using this app, users will be able to do the following:
- Record workouts (number of sets, repetitions, weight, etc.).
- Create and save original training plans.
- Log daily sleep habits.
- Use AI to analyze food and find out detailed nutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fats).
- Visually record fitness results using free charts.
- Enjoy ease of use with a simple and sophisticated user interface that hides
unnecessary information as much as possible.

We want the following people to use our app:
- People who do strength training and weightlifting
- People who want to balance nutrition management, sleep, and exercise
- People who dislike complicated diet and fitness apps.
